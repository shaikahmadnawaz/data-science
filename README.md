# DataScience
Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world.

Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data. It's when you translate data into a story. So use storytelling to generate insight. And with these insights, you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution.

Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form.

Data science is the study of data. Like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, data has real properties, and we need to study them if we're going to work on them. Data Science involves data and some science.

In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science. If you have data, and you have curiosity, and you're working with data, and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it, the very exercise of going through analyzing data, trying to get some answers from it is data science. Data science is relevant today because we have tons of data available. We used to worry about lack of data. Now we have a data deluge. In the past, we didn't have algorithms, now we have algorithms. In the past, the software was expensive, now it's open source and free. In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data, now for a fraction of the cost, we can have gazillions of datasets for a very low cost. So, the tools to work with data, the very availability of data, and the ability to store and analyze data, it's all cheap, it's all available, it's all ubiquitous, it's here. There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.

# How do you get a better solution that is efficient?
You must: Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it.
Gather the data for analysis.
Identify the right tools to use, and develop a data strategy.
Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution.
Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model. 

# What makes someone a data scientist?
I define a data scientist as someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders. I do not use the data size as a restrictive clause. A data below a certain arbitrary threshold does not make one less of a data scientist. Nor is my definition of a data scientist restricted to particular analytic tools, such as machine learning. As long as one has a curious mind, fluency in analytics, and the ability to communicate the findings, I consider the person a data scientist.

# Big Data
 “Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and
disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines.
It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically
process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights
that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder
value.” 

velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value.
These are the V's of Big Data.

# What is Hadoop?
Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.
